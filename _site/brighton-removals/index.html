		<p>DB Movers is a professional moving service providing Brighton removals with a long-established reputation in Brighton, Hove and the surrounding area. We offer local, national and even international moving services, and have over a decade of experience. In addition to domestic home moving, we are pleased to offer office and business moves as well.</p>
		<p>We know first-hand how stressful moving can be. Not only do you have to deal with packing up your former life, saying goodbye to neighbours, school mates, maybe even your workplace; but you have to put down roots in a completely different one. There’s stress and worry at both ends of a house move. Whether you’re moving across the country or across town, those issues will always be present. And if you’re moving your business, you have the added concern of getting your business back up and running in the shortest possible time. The last thing you need to worry about is having your business lose money while you’re shifting locations.</p>
		<p>Are you agonising over transferring your antique chandelier? Or getting a scrape on the piano that has been in the family for generations? No worries! That’s where we come in. A fully insured company, DB Movers have a policy to treat all your possessions with utmost care and respect; as if they were our own.</p>
		<p>In order to provide you with the best possible experience, we will meet with you before the big move to assess all your needs, and present you with a free quote. And since you have enough on your mind, we will leave it with you for consideration when you have time to read the fine print. Speaking of which, everything will be clearly laid out for you in writing,with no hidden fees and no extra costs added later on. The price you see on the quote is the price you pay, it’s as simple as that.</p>
		<p>A big part of our professional service is putting the customer’s needs first; we are always punctual and will be on site at the appointed time. We also provide all the materials needed to safely pack and protect your valued possessions in order to transport them to the new location in a timely manner.</p>
		<p>Are you planning to put some of your possessions in a public storage facility? No problem. DB Movers can arrange to do this for you; we have a full range of options for you to choose from that will fit virtually any budget. If desired, you can pack your own boxes, and we will move them from one location to the next – or, if your budget allows, we will carefully pack and transfer every item from your old home to the new one and unpack them again – whatever your needs, we can accommodate them at a price that will suit you.</p>
		<p>So take some of the stress and worry out of your upcoming move by contacting DB Movers. Our experience and dedication to your satisfaction will make your move that much easier.</p>
