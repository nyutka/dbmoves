		<p>At DB Moves we fully understand the value of your possessions and if you choose our company to carry out your move then you can be sure that our staff will treat your possessions if they were their own.</p>
		<p>Moving house can be an extremely stressful experience with lots of upheaval and a hundred and one things that need to be organised. Choosing DB Movers to carry out your removal will mean one less thing to worry about as you can rely on us to ensure that your move is carried out smoothly and safely.</p>
		<p><strong>Before the move</strong></p>
		<p>We pride ourselves on listening to our customers needs and the first thing we would do when you contact us is to arrange a visit. This will give us the opportunity to sit down with you and fully discuss your requirements. It also means that we can see exactly what needs to be moved and whether there are any items that might require special care and attention such as a piano. The visit gives us a chance to discover what is most important to you about the move and means that we are in a position to give you an accurate and fair quote based on what we have seen for ourselves. The quote is provided for free in writing so that you have the opportunity to consider it fully before deciding whether to proceed. We can guarantee that no hidden extras will be added to the price that you are given. The quote that we provide is exactly what you will be charged for the removal. We are also fully insured.</p>
		<p><strong>On the day</strong></p>
		<p>When removal day finally arrives, we guarantee that our team will arrive on time. You can rest assured that they will come fully equipped with everything that is needed in order to carry out your move and there will be no sudden or unexpected delays.</p>
		<p><strong>Our Services</strong></p>
		<p>We are able to deal with a variety of different types of move. These include a straightforward move to a new house and moving possessions to a storage facility. We also offer a deluxe full service move. If you choose this option then our team will wrap and pack all of your possessions for you as well as actually moving them to your new property.</p>
